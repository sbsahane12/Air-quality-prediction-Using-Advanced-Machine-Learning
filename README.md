# [Project 2: Air-quality-prediction Using Advanced Machine Learning](https://github.com/sbsahane12/Air-quality-prediction-Using-Advanced-Machine-Learning.git) 
As air pollution is a complex mixture of toxic components with considerable impact on humans, forecasting air pollution concentration emerges as a priority for improving life quality. So with the help of Python tools and some Machine Learning algorithms, we try to predict the air quality. 

## Aim :
### In this project we will be building an Air Quality Index Predictor with the help of Machine Learning Models and Auto ML library i.e. TPOT

## Install
This project requires Python 3.6 and the following libraries installed:
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.


## Models trained on: 
1. Linear Regression
2. Xgboost Regressor
3. Random Forest Regressor

****And doing the Hyperameter tuning for the above****
